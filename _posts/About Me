I am a Linux enthusiast who wishes to expand the Antergos Project to include as many Desktop Environments and WMs as possible. Each DE caters to a certain sort of individual. It is my hope that through this project, future Antergos users will be able to choose the DE that is best suited for them. 

### More Information

If you are a beginner in Linux, I would advise visiting my website for beginners [here](https://linuxbasicssite.wordpress.com).

### My Thanks

I would like to extend a warm thank you to all of the developers at Antergos for helping me along here and making this all possible. In addition, I would like to thank all of the supportive users and prospective downloaders for making this worthwhile.Thank you all!
